# Real-Time-Bus-Tracker

This activity makes use of pulling a map of Cambridge from MapBox and adding custom markers along the route between Harvard and MIT. I had never done anything like this before so getting to use an access token and using MapBox was a very interesting task. In the future I think I would like to integrate this to my own home town and possibly tracking my commute to family and friends houses.
